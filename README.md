> I can't figure out how to contact YuokiTani to ask.
> If I am doing something wrong please let me know and I will replace the assets.

I'd also like to give Malcolm Riley a special shout-out for publishing tutorials on how to make Factorio-like assets, and for being really kind when I reached out to him. I would not have made any Blender assets if not for them.

The rest of them I made myself.
I used Blender and GIMP for the sprites.
I kitbashed a lot of the graphics together out of other sprites:
- Lunar rocket silos
- Boompuff propagules
- Science packs
- Some of the tiles
- Molten aluminum
- Archaeological scrap

Pro tip: use GIMP's Rotate Color to recolor Factorio assets. Or, select by color with feathering, cut it, and paste it in a new layer with the blend mode set to "mix". Both look much better than plain tints.

### Code Attribution

- [LordMiguel](https://mods.factorio.com/user/LordMiguel) for their suite of Gleba mods, especially Boompuff Agriculture. I didn't end up using much code directly, but reading it was a huge help nonetheless.
- [Distant Misfires](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/distant-misfires) for the implementation of projectile bullets.
