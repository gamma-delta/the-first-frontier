[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
pktff-tff=Welcome to The First Frontier! The First Frontier makes a lot of changes to vanilla Space Age, some of which aren't very obvious. I've tried to document the most important ones here. They'll unlock as you play.
pktff-viate-welcome=[planet=pktff-viate] is the only moon of [planet=nauvis]. It has no atmosphere, so combustion is impossible, but you can use the lack of interfering pressure to your advantage. In areas disturbed by meteoric activity, [item=pktff-regolith] is rich in [item=iron-ore], [item=pktff-bauxite-ore], and [item=stone]. It also contains deposits of [item=ice] in the shadowed edges of its maria. The day/night cycle is long; finding a way to store energy through the night is essential.\nIt should be a good place to research, and gather the materials required to make your first space platform.
pktff-viate-dust=On some bodies with a low atmosphere or high electrostatic charge, mechanical activity will kick up abrasive dust from the surface into a pollutant. It appears light blue on the map. Dust does not attract enemies in any way; instead, it slows down the activity of complex machines (mostly, those with module slots).\nPaving the ground helps reduce the amount of dust produced -- fortunately it is easy to produce [recipe=pktff-stone-bricks-from-regolith] on [planet=pktff-viate]. More advanced pavement tamps down the dust more. Later you will discover more active ways to remove dust from the air.\nThe simulation above takes place on a surface with dust. For demonstration purposes, the [entity=big-mining-drill] generate more dust than they would normally. The lamps show the throughput of the belt from 1-8; note how the amount of [item=ice] on the belt slowly goes down over time as the [entity=big-mining-drill] gets jammed by the dust.
pktff-rocket-juice-intro=[fluid=thruster-fuel] and [fluid=thruster-oxidizer] are now used to propel rockets into space, as well. The term "rocket propellant" can refer to either of these.\nA given (in-game) volume of propellant represents a certain [font=default-bold]potency[/font], not an actual volume. In other words, a more powerful propellant chemical is represented as simply producing more propellant fluid.
pktff-rocket-juice-many-kinds=Many different chemicals and items are servicable as rocket fuel or oxidizer. To represent this, there are many recipes that "reduce" things into fuel or oxidizer, as well as some recipes that produce a propellant outright.\nRecipes that simply reduce to a propellant always require 10 of their source material if it is a fluid, or 1 if it is an item, and take 1 second to craft. Other recipes that produce propellant directly have more varied costs. The more potent a chemical is, the more propellant fluid it produces per craft.\nAs you go to other planets and discover other processes, you will unlock more efficient ways to make rocket propellants.\nPictured above: [recipe=pktff-thruster-fuel-from-pktff-hydrogen], [recipe=pktff-thruster-fuel-from-ammonia], [recipe=pktff-thruster-fuel-from-rocket-fuel]; [recipe=pktff-thruster-oxidizer-from-pktff-oxygen], [recipe=pktff-thruster-oxidizer-from-pktff-nitric-acid], [recipe=pktff-n2o4-thruster-oxidizer].

pktff-dirty-steel=[recipe=steel-plate] is only formed in a carbon-rich environment, so it cannot be made in a [entity=electric-furnace].\nNote that this means it is difficult to make steel on low-pressure surfaces, as you cannot place burner entities. You will unlock better ways of making steel that do not require burning fuel later.
pktff-flamethrower-suckening=The fire produced by [item=flamethrower-turret] pollutes much more heavily than in the base game. (The handheld [item=flamethrower] is unaffected.)
pktff-rocket-weight=Many items have had their rocket weights altered. In general, lower tiers of items have been made lighter than their higher-tiered counterparts. For example, you can put 200 [item=transport-belt] in a rocket, but only 100 [item=fast-transport-belt].
