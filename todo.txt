[X] How to get aluminum on Gleba and Vulcanus
On Vulc I can make up whatever I want basically
- Lava extraction
- Inclusions in tungsten
- Byproduct of processing iron (with Mg byproduct of processing copper)
Gleeb is harder though.
- Al bacteria? it's been done, although it would be a nice pre-Aquilo boost
- Just don't have it? In this case I need to exclude some material required for rocket parts on each other planet
  - No crafting orbital data cards on Fulgora due to high lightning storms? Make it in orbit
  - whyyyyy is vulcanus so OP
  - Oh, i can restrict ammonia! Making throxidizer harder to get
