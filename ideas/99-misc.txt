=== Environmental Station ===
Acts as a bigger radar.
Can read basically any information I can think it ought to:
- Pollution levels
- Evolution level
- Time of day
- Wind X/Y
- Planet gravity?
- Nastiest enemy in range?
I want to feel like this is a pretty epic upgrade...
but I'm ok with it being the worst of them.
(For example, use this to turn on electrostatic funnelers only at night!)

Would be funny to have a radioactive item that decays in several years.

=== Gravitational Anomalies ===
The way you discover the Shattered Planet.
Somewhat of a new game plus? It's impractically expensive to make
the superluminal jump over there again.
Or perhaps there is a gravity well making it impossible to
go there again.

Discover gravitational anomaly data first off the (little tiny)
surface of the moon of Vulcanus.
(see: relativity & Mercury orbit)

=== Advanced Chemistry ===

Take a note out of Nullius' book: plastic!
Everybody needs plastic!
Perhaps make it out of wood in some way, so you actually have reason to create
wood farms on Nauvis.

=== Replacements for Prod Research ===
They should be similarly resource-intensive and powerful.
But less boring.

Mining prod: Fracking towers
- Distribute special hyper-expensive fracking modules to nearby mining drills
- Consumes lubricant or something using https://mods.factorio.com/mod/zzz-nonstandard-beacons?from=search
- Mayhaps will introduce "drilling fluid" that's used on both tungsten ore and
  to power this thing? That might just be adding a fluid for no reason, but
  you would have to make a lot of it.

Ingredient prod: Doped recipes
- Recipes that use a "trace amount" such that they don't show up in recycling
- Vanilla has:
  = Processing units -- Holmium
  = Scrap Recycling -- just build more recyclers
  = Steel plates -- hydrogen steel? just use carbon-steel with foundries?
  = Plastic -- 
  = LDS -- magpie alloy
  = Rocket fuel -- not really used in this mod, you already get better
    propellant recipes
  = Rocket parts
  = Asteroids (still need to figure out space)
  = Lab prod (???)
- These are in "t1" and "t2" I guess
  = T1:
	+ Carbon steel (Vulcanus -- but this doesn't require anything Vulc-specfiic)
    + Ho-doped circuits (Fulgora). Problem is that plastic is an ingredient in
	  circuits. Have this process only work on green circuits? Or the
	  substrate? I already have tiers of substrate.
	+ Bioplastic (Gleba)
  = T2:
    + LDS (Vulcanus -- magpie alloy)
	+ POC (Gleba -- biophosphor?)
	+ QP (Fulgora -- I'll figure out something to do with these. T4 modules?)
