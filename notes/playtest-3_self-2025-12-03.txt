I should either commit harder to the early start detritus, or give up on it.
I'd rather commit harder.
Should I put Krastorio-style beginner assemblers? Would be nice.

Snapper spawners have a hilarious amount of HP, should probably be nerfed.
it's not interesting to take them out.

Black science doesn't unlock anything until after oil.
Some kind of combat buff would be nice but I'm not sure what?
- Move shotgun turrets earlier probably
- No, these should be their own technology, not part of mili II
- Need to move their sprite a little north to match with gun turrets
